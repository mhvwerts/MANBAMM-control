# MOLTECH-FSS Flow Sensor System

The MOLTECH-FSS Flow Sensor System enables recording of microfluidic flow rates through capillaries, using USB-connected hardware modules. At the heart of these modules there is a Sensirion liquid flow sensor, which is managed by an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, which communicates with a host terminal (typically, a lab PC) through a USB serial connection.

This section of the repository contains the hardware description of the MOLTECH-FSS and the Arduino firmware. The host terminal software (Python programs running on the lab PC) can be found in `python-src` together with the control software for other lab devices (*e.g.*, syringe pumps, fluidic valves).
